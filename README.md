Single page static site to display my work and experience.

## Technologies

* HTML
* Sass
* Grunt
* Github pages (hosting)
* [Dinkers Static Site Builder](https://github.com/Dinkers/Static-Site-Builder)

## Set up

Install the dependencies then run the development server:

```bash
npm i; grunt
```

The server will now watch `styles/sass/styles.sass` and `index.html` and reload the page on **localhost:3000** when they have changed.
