                <h2><span>Web Engineer</span></h2>

                <p>I write software that is tested, readable, and maintainable. I currently achieve this with Python, using frameworks like Django and Flask.</p>
                <p>I also act as the bridge between people and code. I do this in the form of consultancy, mentoring, and the co-ordination of remote development efforts.</p>

                <h2><span>Work</span></h2>


                <h3>Whitespace Ventures - Lead Web Engineer</h3>

                <p>I built internal products, including a financial modelling application, a development platform for enterprise companies - primarily in Python with a bespoke framework we created in-house.</p>
                <p>I provided consultancy for start up and enterprise level clients. My input ranged from technological advisory, to indepth multi-year technical roadmaps designed to achieve commercial success.</p>
                <p>I interviewed/hired developers and built out teams as internal products progressed. I integrated new hires culturally and  technically, defining standards and workflows essential for scale. I also mentored developers in order to grow team skillsets efficiently.</p>

                <h3>Custom - Lead Web Engineer</h3>
                <p>I built the server-side software for a fashion based search engine, that also allowed users to track fashion bloggers and buy the  clothes they were promoting.</p>
                <p>The key features of the technology were the API (Flask), spidering service (Scrapy) and Natural Language Processing service (NLTK). I built this on a micro-service architecture, with continous integration.</p>
                <p>I hired and mentored a remote team to help me build the product. I also worked very closely with the CEO, creative director, and  front-end developer to identify the business goals, and define the technical solutions to achieve them.</p>

                <h3>Agency Work - Various</h3>
                <p>I worked with a variety of technologies in a range of languages, including PHP (Drupal) and C# (Webforms, MVC). I quickly learned the required stack for a project and implemented the required technical solution.</p>
                <p>I liased directly with clients, and discussed with team members of multiple disciplines (design, user experience, business analyst) to create technical solutions appropriate for the business goals of the client.</p>

                <h2><span>Play</span></h2>


                <h3>Tigin - Founder</h3>
                <p>I’m building a company that approaches the start-up method from the Jobs To Be Done perspective, focusing on the learn start-up methodology. I want to be able to successfully bring a SaaS to market with minimal investment, consistently.</p>
                <p>What this means in practice, is focusing more on the process of bringing an idea to market, than any specific idea itself. I am building out multiple products to refine the Market Research, MVP development, Marketing, and Feedback Based Iteration stages of product development.</p>
                <p>The product I am currently working on is <a href="https://pryma.io">Pryma</a>, an e-sports based knowledge marketplace, providing e-sports players an additional revenue stream to make it a more viable career. Pryma will leverage the domain knowledge and passionate fan-bases of e-sports players to disrupt the “market” of low quality guides that are available for free across multiple sites that rely on ad-revenue.</p>

                <h3>Dinkers - Co-ordinator</h3>
                <p>I manage and co-ordinate a the development efforts of a varied remote group of engineers. This primarily takes the form of technical knowledge share, but Dinkers also works together to create technical solutions. This can be for personal reasons such as buying highly sough after tickets, or simply to learn new technologies.</p>
                <p>This passion project not only encourages me to learn and share technical knowledge more regularly, it also allows me to refine my managerial technique. This ranges from the organisational and communication skills required for collaboration, to technical implementation of tools to ease the logistical friction of teamwork.</p>
                <p>An example of this would be the implementation of the knowledge share site in Jekyll using Markdown documents, making it very easy for all engineers to edit and contribute technical knowledge. Additionally, the site is hosted with GitHub Pages, reducing the effort needed for any changes to reach the rest of the group. This implementation makes it a joy for all engineers to contribute, which in turn encourages them to do so more.</p>

                <h3>Codebar - Mentor</h3>
                <p>I teach under-represented groups at coding workshops on a weekly basis. While my driving motivation for this is personal enjoyment, I have noticed significant benefits with regard to my professional career.</p>
                <p>The skills required to mentor at a workshop are by and large the same as those required the mentor junior developers in a team. I find I am able to create a work environment in which developers are not afraid to make mistakes, which subsequently encourages collaboration and self development. These are key to the long term success of any team.</p>
