            <h3>Experience</h3>
        
            <div>

              <h4>Solution Architect - Tractable</h4>

              <p>
                For this role I travelled to various regions to <span class="bold">meet with new/potential customers to understand how we could most 
                effectively leverage our products to meet their needs.</span> I also <span class="bold">built engineering teams from the ground up, mentored 
                engineers, and developed an effective working culture</span> between the in-house technical and business teams.
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">stakeholder management</span> and 
                <span class="bold">system design.</span> As it was a start up, I was also responsible for engineering delivery, for this I used 
                <span class="bold">Python</span> (Flask and proprietary technologies), <span class="bold">Typescript</span> (React), 
                <span class="bold">SQL</span>, <span class="bold">Kafka,</span> and various <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Tractable to be <span class="bold">architecting and building a custom solution with very limited 
                engineering capacity</span> as a proof of concept for a potential customer. This <span class="bold">solution went on to win Tractableâ€™s 
                largest contract</span> at the time (more than double the previous biggest) in the newly entered region of Japan.
              </p>

              <p>
                (Tractable offers an AI solution that identifies when car repair bodyshops are over-charging for a repair to 
                save the time and money of car insurance companies.)

              <h4>Lead Web Engineer - Whitespace Ventures</h4>

              <p>
                During my time at Whitespace Ventures, I had two main responsibilities. The first was to <span class="bold">assist enterprise 
                companies in assimilating new team members</span> after acquiring start ups, and the second was to <span class="bold">architect 
                and build various internal tools.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">system design,</span> <span class="bold">hiring,</span> 
                and <span class="bold">mentoring.</span> When building the internal tools I used <span class="bold">Python</span> (GQL and proprietary 
                technologies), <span class="bold">Javascript</span> (React), <span class="bold">SQL,</span> and various <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Whitespace to be the <span class="bold">creation of a custom web framework in Python that easily allowed 
                the use of both GraphQL and HTTP</span> to be used as a base for all future applications. This <span class="bold">sped up development 
                dramatically</span> and is <span class="bold">still being used to this day.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                (Whitespace Ventures works with various enterprise and start-up companies and provides expertise to help them build and implement complex 
                technical solutions.)

              <h4>Lead Web Engineer - Custom</h4>

              <p>
                I lead the backend engineering effort for the Custom web application. This involved <span class="bold">architecting and building the 
                application</span> and various features, and <span class="bold">managing remote engineers.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">remote line management,</span> 
                <span class="bold">system design,</span> and <span class="bold">project management.</span> For the web engineering aspect of the role I 
                used <span class="bold">Python</span> (Flask, Scrapy, NLTK) to build the API, retail store scrapers, and NLP product identifier, 
                <span class="bold">SQL</span> for data management, and I maintained the infrastructure with various <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Custom to be the <span class="bold">creation of an NLP engine from scratch.</span> It enabled the 
                application to identify the clothing product a fashion influencer was talking about in their social media post, locate it in our database, 
                and present it to the user for purchase. This required me to <span class="bold">understand linguistic rules</span> more deeply and 
                <span class="bold">hire/manage remote developers</span> to deliver a quality solution quickly under a limited budget. 
              </p>

              <p>
                (Custom was a fashion search engine and social media aggregation that allowed users to more easily find clothes relevant to them.)
              </p>
