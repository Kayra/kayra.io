            <h3>Experience</h3>
        
            <div>

              <h4>Solution Architect - Tractable</h4>

              <p>
                For this role I travelled to various regions to <span class="bold">meet with new/potential customers to understand how we could most 
                effectively leverage our products to meet their needs.</span> I also <span class="bold">built engineering teams from the ground up, mentored 
                engineers, and developed an effective working culture</span> between the in-house technical and business teams.
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">stakeholder management</span> and 
                <span class="bold">system design.</span> As it was a start up, I was also responsible for engineering delivery, for this I used 
                <span class="bold">Python</span> (Flask and proprietary technologies), <span class="bold">Typescript</span> (React), 
                <span class="bold">SQL</span>, <span class="bold">Kafka,</span> and various <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Tractable to be <span class="bold">architecting and building a custom solution with very limited 
                engineering capacity</span> as a proof of concept for a potential customer. This <span class="bold">solution went on to win Tractable’s 
                largest contract</span> at the time (more than double the previous) in the newly entered region of Japan.
              </p>

              <p>
                (Tractable offers an AI solution that identifies when car repair bodyshops are over-charging for a repair to 
                save the time and money of car insurance companies.)

              <h4>Lead Web Engineer - Whitespace Ventures</h4>

              <p>
                During my time at Whitespace Ventures, I had two main responsibilities. The first was to <span class="bold">assist enterprise 
                companies in assimilating new team members</span> after acquiring start ups, and the second was to <span class="bold">architect 
                and build various internal tools.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">system design,</span> <span class="bold">hiring,</span> 
                and <span class="bold">mentoring.</span> When building the internal tools I used <span class="bold">Python</span> (GQL and proprietary 
                technologies), <span class="bold">Javascript</span> (React), <span class="bold">SQL,</span> and various <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Whitespace to be the <span class="bold">creation of a custom web framework in Python that easily allowed 
                the use of both GraphQL and HTTP</span> to be used as a base for all future applications. This <span class="bold">sped up development 
                dramatically</span> and is <span class="bold">still being used to this day.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                (Whitespace Ventures works with various enterprise and start-up companies and provides expertise to help them build and implement complex 
                technical solutions.)

              <h4>Lead Web Engineer - Custom</h4>

              <p>
                I lead the backend engineering effort for the Custom web application. This involved <span class="bold">architecting and building the 
                application</span> and various features, and <span class="bold">managing remote engineers.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">remote line management,</span> 
                <span class="bold">system design,</span> and <span class="bold">project management.</span> For the web engineering aspect of the role I 
                used <span class="bold">Python</span> (Flask, Scrapy, NLTK) to build the API, retail store scrapers, and NLP product identifier, 
                <span class="bold">SQL</span> for data management, and I maintained the infrastructure by working with various 
                <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Custom to be the <span class="bold">creation of an NLP engine from scratch.</span> It enabled the 
                application to identify the clothing product a fashion influencer was talking about in their social media post, locate it in our database, 
                and present it to the user for purchase. This required me to <span class="bold">understand linguistic rules</span> more deeply and 
                <span class="bold">hire/manage remote developers</span> to deliver a quality solution quickly under a limited budget. 
              </p>

              <p>
                (Custom was a fashion search engine and social media aggregation that allowed users to more easily find clothes relevant to them.)
              </p>

              <h4>Freelance and Contract Work - Various</h4>

              <p>
                During this time in my career I <span class="bold">worked with agencies to develop applications and features</span> for their customers. 
                I focused on delivering <span class="bold">high quality work</span> quickly and consistently.	
              </p>

              <p>
                I worked with <span class="bold">C#</span> (.net MVP), <span class="bold">PHP</span> (Drupal) and <span class="bold">Python</span> (Flask). 
                Delivering well relied on <span class="bold">stakeholder management,</span> specifically this meant <span class="bold">communicating technical 
                information with project managers</span> in a way that enabled them to effectively build relationships with their clients.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My biggest achievement was <span class="bold">delivering a feature</span> that was so well received by the client that they went on to 
                request the agency who contracted me to <span class="bold">rebuild their entire site.</span>
              </p>

                Tigin is a company I founded as a side project to explore the process of bringing an <span class="bold">idea to market without traditional investment.</span> 
                The focus is putting an idea through four stages: market research, MVP development, marketing, and feedback based iteration. I’m currently building 
                an <span class="bold">e-sports video game guide platform.</span>

                Metuo is a <span class="bold">photography portfolio</span> I built using <span class="bold">AWS</span> (EC2, RDS, S3) and <span class="bold">Docker</span> for 
                hosting, <span class="bold">Python/Flask</span> and <span class="bold">Psql</span> for the API, and <span class="bold">Js/React</span> for the client. An 
                interesting feature is the <span class="bold">IP geolocated tagging</span>; if I have taken pictures near you it will 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Kayra/metuo/blob/master/client/src/requests.js#L34">display those first.</a> It was very rewarding to start

                overhead. I found this to be a great way to <span class="bold">incentivise craft building,</span> and have received feedback from other members reflecting 
                the same sentiment.

              <h4>Mentorship</h4>

              <p>
                I <span class="bold">personally enjoy mentoring</span>, and have been doing it secondary school (troubled lower school children), through university 
                (first year students), and more recently at coding workshops. My last regular mentoring experience was coaching at 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://codebar.io/london">CodeBar</a>, a <span class="bold">workshop for under-represented groups in engineering</span> 
                (women, PoC, etc), where I helped engineers with personal projects and assignments. I also wrote some 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/codebar/tutorials">Python tutorials</a> for use by other coaches. 
              </p>

              <p>
                I find mentoring very rewarding, it builds <span class="bold">communication skills</span> and <span class="bold">empathy</span>, and helps me foster a 
                <span class="bold">deep understanding of technical concepts</span> that allows me to <span class="bold">communicate them to non-technical</span> people 
                more easily.

              <h4>Photography</h4>
              <p>
                For me, photography is an <span class="bold">entertaining, creative outlet.</span> It helps me to be <span class="bold">more attentive during my travels,</span> 
                and is a <span class="bold">great way to connect with people</span> at events. I’m self taught, and enjoy the technical aspect as much as the creative. The 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://metuo.io">portfolio site</a> I’ve created is the best place to see some of my work.
