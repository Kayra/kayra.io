                <h2>Web Engineer</h2>

                <p>I write software that is tested, readable, and maintainable. I currently achieve this with Python, using frameworks like Django and Flask.</p>
                <p>I also act as the bridge between people and code. I do this in the form of consultancy, mentoring, and the co-ordination of remote development efforts.</p>

                <h3>Whitespace Ventures - Lead Web Engineer</h3>

                <p>I built internal products, including a financial modelling application, a development platform for enterprise companies - primarily in Python.</p>
                <p>I provided consultancy for start up and enterprise level clients. My input ranged from technological advisory, to indepth multi-year technical roadmaps designed to achieve commercial success.</p>
                <p>I interviewed/hired developers and built out teams as internal products progressed. I integrated new hires culturally and  technically, defining standards and workflows essential for scale. I also mentored developers in order to grow team skillsets efficiently.</p>
