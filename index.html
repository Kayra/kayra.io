            <h3>Experience</h3>
        
            <div>

              <h4>Solution Architect - Tractable</h4>

              <p>
                For this role I travelled to various countries to <span class="bold">meet with new/potential customers to understand how we could most 
                effectively leverage our products to meet their needs.</span> I also <span class="bold">built engineering teams from the ground up, mentored 
                engineers, and developed an effective working culture</span> between the in-house technical and business teams.
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">stakeholder management</span> and 
                <span class="bold">system design.</span> As it was a start up, I was also responsible for engineering delivery, and primarily worked with 
                <span class="bold">Python</span> (Flask and proprietary technologies), <span class="bold">Typescript</span> (React), 
                <span class="bold">SQL</span>, <span class="bold">Kafka,</span> and various <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Tractable to be <span class="bold">architecting and building a custom solution with very limited 
                engineering capacity</span> as a proof of concept for a potential customer. This <span class="bold">solution went on to win Tractable’s 
                largest contract</span> at the time (more than double the previous) in the newly entered region of Japan.
              </p>

              <p>
                (Tractable offers an AI solution that identifies when car repair bodyshops are over-charging for a repair to 
                save the time and money of car insurance companies.)

              <h4>Lead Web Engineer - Whitespace Ventures</h4>

              <p>
                During my time at Whitespace Ventures, I had two main responsibilities. The first was to <span class="bold">assist enterprise 
                companies in assimilating new teams</span> after acquiring start ups, and the second was to <span class="bold">architect 
                and build various internal tools.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">system design,</span> <span class="bold">hiring,</span> 
                and <span class="bold">mentoring.</span> When building the internal tools I used <span class="bold">Python</span> (GQL and proprietary 
                technologies), <span class="bold">Javascript</span> (React), <span class="bold">SQL,</span> and various <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Whitespace to be the <span class="bold">creation of a custom web framework in Python</span> that easily 
                allowed the use of both GraphQL and HTTP to be used as a base for all future applications. This <span class="bold">sped up development 
                drastically</span> and is <span class="bold">still being used to this day.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                (Whitespace Ventures works with various enterprise and start-up companies and provides expertise to help them build and implement complex 
                technical solutions.)

              <h4>Lead Web Engineer - Custom</h4>

              <p>
                I lead the backend engineering effort for the Custom web application. This involved <span class="bold">architecting and building the 
                application</span> and it's various features, and <span class="bold">managing remote engineers.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                The main skills that were responsible for my success in this role were <span class="bold">remote line management,</span> 
                <span class="bold">system design,</span> and <span class="bold">project management.</span> For the web engineering aspect of the role I 
                used <span class="bold">Python</span> (Flask, Scrapy, NLTK) to build the API, retail store scrapers, and NLP product identifier, 
                <span class="bold">SQL</span> for data management, and I maintained the infrastructure by working with various 
                <span class="bold">AWS services.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                I consider my biggest achievement at Custom to be the <span class="bold">creation of an NLP engine from scratch.</span> It enabled the 
                application to <span class="bold">identify the clothing product</span> a fashion influencer was talking about in their social media post, 
                <span class="bold">locate it</span> in our database, and <span class="bold">present it to the user for purchase.</span> This required me to 
                <span class="bold">understand linguistic rules</span> more deeply and <span class="bold">hire/manage remote developers</span> to deliver a quality 
                solution quickly under a limited budget. 
              </p>

              <p>
                (Custom was a fashion search engine and social media aggregation web application that allowed users to more easily find clothes relevant to them.)

              <h4>Freelance and Contract Work - Various</h4>

              <p>
                During this time in my career I <span class="bold">worked with agencies to develop applications and features</span> for their clients. 
                I focused on delivering <span class="bold">high quality work</span> quickly and consistently.	
              </p>

              <p>
                I worked with <span class="bold">C#</span> (.net MVP), <span class="bold">PHP</span> (Drupal), and <span class="bold">Python</span> (Flask). 
                Delivering well also relied on <span class="bold">stakeholder management,</span> specifically this meant <span class="bold">communicating 
                technical information with project managers</span> in a way that enabled them to effectively build relationships with their clients.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My biggest achievement during this time was <span class="bold">delivering a feature</span> that was so well received by the client that they 
                went on to request the agency who contracted me to <span class="bold">rebuild their entire site.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                Tigin is a company I founded as a side project to explore the process of bringing an <span class="bold">idea to market without traditional investment.</span> 
                The focus is putting an idea through four stages: market research, MVP development, marketing, and feedback based iteration. I’m currently building 
                an <span class="bold">e-sports video game guide platform.</span>

                Metuo is a <span class="bold">photography portfolio</span> I built using <span class="bold">AWS</span> (EC2, RDS, S3) and <span class="bold">Docker</span> for 
                hosting, <span class="bold">Python/Flask</span> and <span class="bold">SQL</span> for the back-end API, and <span class="bold">JS/React</span> for the 
                front-end client. An interesting feature is the <span class="bold">IP geolocated tagging</span>; if I have taken pictures near you the application will

                I found this to be a great way to <span class="bold">incentivise craft honing,</span> and have received feedback from other members reflecting 
                the same sentiment.

              <h4>Mentorship</h4>

              <p>
                I <span class="bold">personally enjoy mentoring</span>, and have been doing it in secondary school (troubled lower school children), through university 
                (first year students), and more recently at coding workshops. My last regular mentoring experience was coaching at 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://codebar.io/london">CodeBar</a>, a <span class="bold">workshop for under-represented groups in engineering</span> 
                (women, PoC, etc), where I helped engineers with personal projects and assignments. I also wrote some 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/codebar/tutorials">Python tutorials</a> for use by other coaches at Codebar workshops across the world. 
              </p>

              <p>
                I find mentoring very rewarding, it develops <span class="bold">communication skills</span> and <span class="bold">empathy</span>, and helps me build a 
                <span class="bold">deep understanding of technical concepts</span> that allows me to <span class="bold">communicate them to non-technical</span> people 
                more easily. Any opportunity to do this in a professional manner is very welcome.
              </p>

              <h4>Photography</h4>
              <p>
                For me, photography is an <span class="bold">entertaining, creative outlet.</span> It helps me to be <span class="bold">more attentive during my travels,</span> 
                and is a <span class="bold">great way to connect with people</span> at events. I’m self taught, and I enjoy the technical aspect as much as the creative. The 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://metuo.io">portfolio site</a> I’ve created is the best place to see some of my work.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Music</h4>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Music is important to me.</span> It’s not only a pleasurable pastime, but also a way to <span class="bold">learn about other cultures</span> 
                I wouldn’t otherwise be exposed to, and a great way to <span class="bold">connect with people.</span> I really like discovering interesting looking records when 
                travelling, I attend a lot of live performances, and I’m thinking of building a custom tool to help manage my 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/golzernurf?si=BxCZ8aXIT8Kg5Obuc4NTVQ">250+ Spotify playlists.</a> I’m <span class="bold">always 
                interested in discovering new music,</span> so if there is an artist or track you are passionate about please <span class="bold">don’t hesitate to drop me a 
                message.</span>
