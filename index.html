                <h2><span>Web Engineer</span></h2>

                <p>I write software that is tested, readable, and maintainable. I currently achieve this with Python, using frameworks like Django and Flask.</p>
                <p>I also act as the bridge between people and code. I do this in the form of consultancy, mentoring, and the co-ordination of remote development efforts.</p>

                <h3>Whitespace Ventures - Lead Web Engineer</h3>

                <p>I built internal products, including a financial modelling application, a development platform for enterprise companies - primarily in Python.</p>
                <p>I provided consultancy for start up and enterprise level clients. My input ranged from technological advisory, to indepth multi-year technical roadmaps designed to achieve commercial success.</p>
                <p>I interviewed/hired developers and built out teams as internal products progressed. I integrated new hires culturally and  technically, defining standards and workflows essential for scale. I also mentored developers in order to grow team skillsets efficiently.</p>

                <h3>Custom - Lead Web Engineer</h3>
                <p>I built the server-side software for a fashion based search engine, that also allowed users to track fashion bloggers and buy the  clothes they were promoting.</p>
                <p>The key features of the technology were the API (Flask), spidering service (Scrapy) and Natural Language Processing service (NLTK). I built this on a micro-service architecture, with continous integration.</p>
                <p>I hired and mentored a remote team to help me build the product. I also worked very closely with the CEO, creative director, and  front-end developer to identify the business goals, and define the technical solutions to achieve them.</p>
